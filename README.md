# ðŸ©º Diabetes-Classification
A simple machine learning model that detects early-stage diabetes in patients based on medical features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.
Deployed with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) for an interactive demo.
## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine learning model >> XGboost for best results
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- User-friendly script/notebook for making predictions

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The project uses the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle.
